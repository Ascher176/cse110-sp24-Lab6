1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This provides feedback on the code and ensures that it is up to standards before the code can be added into shared repository. It also allows us to automate the testing process which can be quite convenient and encourages continuous integration (we test the code every step not just when everything complete to make it easier to debug and make changes).
2. No. Whether the output is correct can be tested with simple unit tests. We don't need to simulate user interaction with the program to check the output of a specific function.
